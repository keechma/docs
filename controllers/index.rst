Controllers
===========

Controllers in Keechma react to route changes and implement any code
that has side effects.

-  Controllers make AJAX requests.
-  Controllers mutate the application’s state
-  Controllers can connect to web sockets and react to received
   messages, etc.

Anything that produces a side effect is implemented in a controller.
**Controllers are the only place in the application where you have
access to the application’s state atom.**

For each URL you can have multiple controllers running at once. Each
controller managing a substate of the application. This way you can
split the application logic in small pieces, with clearly defined
responsibilites.

How controllers work
--------------------

Controllers have their behavior defined with multimethods which can be
overridden with specific implementations. They have a number of
implemented functions but right now we’re only interested in the
``params`` function.

The ``params`` function receives the route params and returns a subset
of the params needed for the controller to run or ``nil``. The
Controller Manager relies on the return value of the ``params`` function
to decide if the controller should be started, stopped or left alone.

Whenever the URL changes, the Controller Manager will do the following:

1. It will call the ``params`` function of all registered controllers
2. It will compare the returned value to the previous value (returned on
   the previous URL change)
3. Based on the returned value it will do the following:

   1. If the previous value was ``nil`` and the current value is ``nil``
      it won’t do a thing
   2. If the previous value was ``nil`` and the current value is not
      ``nil`` it will start the controller
   3. If the previous value was not ``nil`` and the current value is
      ``nil`` it will stop the controller
   4. If the previous value was not ``nil`` and the current value is not
      ``nil`` but those values are same, it won’t do a thing
   5. If the previous value was not ``nil`` and the current value is not
      ``nil`` but those values are different it will restart the
      controller

An example
~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s say you have to implement a note taking application (similar to
Evernote). You have two URLs:

1. An URL that takes you to the list of notes
2. An URL that will show the list of notes and a detailed view of the
   selected note.

The routes could look like this:

.. code-block:: clojure

    (def routes [":page"
                 ":page/:note-id"])

-  When the user goes to the URL ``/starred`` the params received by the
   Controller Manager would be ``{:page "starred"}``
-  When the user goes to the URL ``/starred/1`` the params received by
   the Controller Manager would be ``{:page "starred" :note-id 1}``

Since we need to show the list of notes on both URLs, the ``NoteList``
controller should just care about the ``:page`` param:

.. code-block:: clojure

    (defrecord NoteListController [])

    (defmethod controller/params NoteListController [_ route-params]
      (get-in route-params [:data :page]))

The ``NoteList`` controller’s ``params`` function ensures that it will
be running on each URL that has the ``:page`` param.

The ``NoteDetails`` controller should run only when the ``:note-id``
param is present:

.. code-block:: clojure

    (defrecord NoteDetailsController [])

    (defmethod controller/params NoteDetailsController [_ route-params]
      (get-in route-params [:data :note-id]))

When the user is on the ``/starred`` page the ``NoteDetails`` controller
will not be running. It will only run on the ``/starred/1`` URL.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="diagram">

.. raw:: html

   </div>

When using the controllers to manage the application state mutations you
can ensure the following:

1. State changes will be deterministic. Based on the route, you know
   which controllers are running on the page.
2. Data is loaded at the right time, when the controller is started.
3. Domain logic is split into small, bite-sized parts, each controller
   implements only the subset of the page logic.

**Controllers in Keechma are future proof**. If the UI layout changed
and the note details page doesn’t show the list of notes anymore, the
only thing that you would need to update is the ``NoteList``
controller’s ``params`` function; everything else would remain the same.

If React allows you to reason about your app like you’re re-rendering
everything every time something changes, **Keechma’s controllers allow
you to reason about your app like you’re reloading everything every time
the URL changes**.

Handling user actions
---------------------

Besides data loading, controllers have another task: they react to user
commands.

Whenever the user performs an action - clicks on a button or submits a
form - that action is sent to the Controller Manager. Based on the
``:topic``, this action will be routed to the appropriate controller.

Each controller can implement the ``handler`` function which receives
the ``in-chan`` as an argument. User commands will be placed on that
channel and the controller reacts accordingly.

.. code-block:: clojure

    (defrecord UserController [])

    (defmethod controller/handler UserController [_ app-db in-chan _])
    ;; Commands will be placed on the `in-chan` which is passed into the handler function

UI components don’t define the ``:topic`` at the sending time, it is
globally set for each UI component.

.. code-block:: clojure

    (defn renderer [ctx]
        [:button {:on-click #(ui/send-command ctx :reload-user)} "Reload User"])
    ;; Define a (Reagent) component that sends the command

    (defn button-component (ui/constructor {:renderer renderer
                                     :topic :user})
    ;; Set up the component

When you define the application config map (which will be used to start
and stop the application), you register each controller under the
``key``. This key will be used as a ``:topic`` on which the controller
will listen to commands.

.. code-block:: clojure

    (def app-config {:controllers {:user UserController}
                     ;; UserController will listen on the `:user` topic
                     :components {:main button-component}})

Controllers can only receive commands if they are currently running.
Otherwise, the command will be dropped.
