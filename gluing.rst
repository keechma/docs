Gluing everything together
==========================

In previous articles, we covered everything you need to understand to
build an application with Keechma. Thereâ€™s one last question: how do we
assemble everything and render it on the page?

Keechma comes with a library that brings it all together; it:

1. Binds the router to the history change event
2. Creates a system from the components you registered and resolves
   their dependencies
3. Starts the controller manager
4. Mounts the application to the DOM element

Starting and stopping
---------------------

With ``start!`` and ``stop!``, Keechma applications can simply be turned
on and off. Stopping the app will do the cleanup (unbind the router) and
remove it from the page.

.. code-block:: clojure

    (def app {[...list of routes...]
              :controllers {...map of controllers...}
              :components {...map of components...}
              :subscriptions {...map of component subscriptions...}})

    (def running-app (app-state/start! app))
    ;; Starts the application and mounts it to the DOM

    (stop! running-app)
    ;; Stops the application and unmounts it from the DOM

Communication between the application parts
-------------------------------------------

When starting the app, Keechma creates a commands channel that can be
used by the UI components to send commands to the controllers. Keys used
to register the controllers are topics on which they listen for
messages.

Example:

.. code-block:: clojure

    (def definition {:controllers {:restaurants (c-restaurants/->Controller) ;; listens on the `restaurants` topic}
                     :html-element (.getElementById js/document "app")
                     :subscriptions {...map of component subscriptions...}
                     :components {...map of components...}})

When you want a component to be able to send a messages to a controller,
you have to ``assoc`` it a ``:topic``:

.. code-block:: clojure

    (def system
      (ui-component/system
        {:restaurants (assoc restaurants-component :topic :restaurants)}))

    ;; Now when you send a message from the component it will be picked by the :restaurants controller:

    (defn restaurants-renderer [ctx]
      (ui-component/send-command :command-name command-args))
